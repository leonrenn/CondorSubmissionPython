# CondorSubmissionPython

Python script for submitting jobs via condor on lxplus.

## Short Notice

This script was not written by me but was passed around in the ATLAS community as a helping tool for submitting multiple jobs.<br>
I have found it useful to make this public since it is an easy to use tool to get condor jobs work.<br>
If anyone knows the original author please let me know, so I can give credits to him/her.
